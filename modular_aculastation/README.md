<h1 align="center">Aculastation Code Module</h1>

If the change only modifies a few lines (See: #3), Sinply add, for example, `//Aculastation Change #3: Ups screensize to 21x15`
If its a bug, or QoL change that would benefit both Acula & Bee, it should be PRd [upstream](https://github.com/BeeStation/BeeStation-Hornet) to Beestation.

Otherwise, where possible, changes should be fitted into this module.
